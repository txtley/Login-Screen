LOGIN SCREEN FOR A VIRTUAL FIREWORK DISPLAY

This project is helping me expand my knowledge on programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which are all used for web development. I have created a basic 
log in screen that allows a user to log in if they have an existing account, or if they dont, a link will appear which allows them to create an account of their own by 
filling in information such as name, email, phone number, address and date of birth which will then get stored in a textfile using node.js. This project is ongoing and is
giving me a great oppurunity to learn new frameworks and syntax other than Python.
