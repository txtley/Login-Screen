LOGIN SCREEN FOR MY FIREWORK STORE  (currently still developing the project)

This project is helping me expand my knowledge on programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which are all used for web development. I have created a basic log in screen that allows a user to log in if they have an existing account, or if they dont, a link will appear which allows them to create an account of their own by filling in information such as name, email, phone number, address and date of birth which will then get stored in a textfile using express. This project is ongoing and isgiving me a great oppurunity to learn new frameworks and syntax other than Python. I have also made the main site more specific to the shop. For example, their social media links would send them to GoDaddy's social medias instead of the shop's personal ones.I also included videos of some of the products that we're selling so that any potential customers can get to 'try before they buy' virtually to ensure we're delivering the best customer service. This is something I noticed other websites werent doing and I wanted to change that to improve the customer's experince and make them feel valued. Apart from that, I am currently developing pages for the different types of fireworks that are sold, with a main page that is quick and easy to navigate for the user.
